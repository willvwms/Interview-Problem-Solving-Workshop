Problem:
Write a function WITHOUT brute forcing (looping) to build up a factorial of n! which determines the number of trailing zeroes. 

Heart of problem: 
Trailing zeroes are result of factors that include factors (5 & 2)

Basic solution: 
* Number of pairs of (5 & 2) in factors will determine the number of trailing zeros.
* Write a function that: 
 - decomposes all factors up to n
 - counts up all 5s
 - counts up all 2s
 - returns whichever count is smaller
* Even numbers will always count as "2" because they contain it as a factor

Hints:
* use while loop
