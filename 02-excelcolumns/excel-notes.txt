PROBLEM:
* Given a column title as appears in an Excel sheet, return its corresponding column number.

REQUIREMENTS:
* Take any number of letters ("A", "AB", "CBE", etc)

PSEUDOCODE: 

helper function: getLetterValue(letter):
	return the number value of a single letter

helper function: raiseByPower(number, exponent):
	return the number * base (26) raised to exponent

function: getPositionNumber(excelColumnLetters):
	
	initialize an exponent by subtracting 1 from len of excelColumnLetters
	
	initialize an accumulator to zero
	
	loop: iterate thru each char of excelColumnLetters:
		access curr letter of excelColumnLetters
		get value of curr letter by invoking getLetterValue (curr letter) 
		increase accumulator by invoking raiseByPower (letterValue, exponent)
		decrement exponent 
	
	return accumulator
