Problem:
Write a function WITHOUT brute forcing (looping) to build up a factorial of n! which determines the number of trailing zeroes. 

Heart of problem: 
Trailing zeroes are result of factors that include a 5 and a 2.

Basic solution: 
Number of 5s in the factors will determine the number of trailing zeros.
* Every time you have one 5 and one even number (i.e., a factor that can be itself factored down to a 2), the 5 and 2 result in a 0 (10).

Hints:
* 
* while loop

Observations from the Google Sheet:
0! to 4!: 	no 5s in factors, so no 0s
5! - 9!:
